# CheckTheFacts
Check the facts: Higher Education CBS project

This code is for a prototype made as part of an internship at the CBS. 
This prototype includes openly available data from DUO, CBS, OpenStreetMap and PDOK. 
You can check out the current running example here: https://jasminkareem.shinyapps.io/CTFv2-nl/





Note: It should be noted that a part of the code used comes from the example of RadaR. It was a nice example of how to design a dashboard in R shiny, so it was used as a point of inspiration. Whilst, the CSS file is almost the same as the example in RadaR, most of the code is different to this example. See: https://github.com/ceefluz/radar
